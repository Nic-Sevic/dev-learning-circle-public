A menu plugin from the dev learning circle
Displays a grid of menu items via a shortcode.
Item data is stored in DB in a table created by the plugin ( wp_nisaya_menu_items) and is obtained with apiFetch. 
Plugin is built from a combination of php and React.
Developing the plugin involved learning how to set up a dev environment including webpack, babel, and docker.

This repo contains only the code that I believe is useful to share publicly

The full fork is https://github.com/Nic-Sevic/dev-learning-circle and I can share access as needed
